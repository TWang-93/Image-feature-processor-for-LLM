# Image-feature-processor-for-LLM
To reduce the entry barrier for users and ensure the reproducibility of feature processing, we developed an integrated image feature processing tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) .  This tool enables one-click feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, and allows the processed results to be exported in a structured format.

This research developed a user-friendly, integrated image feature processing system with a graphical user interface (GUI) to simplify technical use and boost efficiency.  Key features include:

* Automated workflow:
* One-click image feature extraction using a pre-trained ResNet18 model.
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
* Automatic dataset splitting (training, validation, and test sets).

Users only need to execute run the script and complete the entire processing flow through intuitive interface controlsï¼š
```sh
Image Feature Processor.py
