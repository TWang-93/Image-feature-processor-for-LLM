# Image-feature-processor-for-LLM
To reduce the entry barrier for users and ensure the reproducibility of feature processing, we developed an integrated image feature processing tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) .  This tool enables one-click feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, and allows the processed results to be exported in a structured format.
